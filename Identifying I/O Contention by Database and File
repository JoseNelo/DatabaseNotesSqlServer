sys.dm_io_virtual_file_stats DMV (this DMV shows data equivalent to the
fn_virtualfilestats function).

measured in
milliseconds and represent the total time users had to wait for read or write I/O operations to complete on a file
since the instance was last restarted or the database created.

return statistics about each database
and file on the SQL Server instance

This DMV takes two input parameters: the first is the database ID, and the
second is the file ID. Designating NULL for the database ID shows results for all databases. Designating NULL for
the file ID results in showing all files for the database.
