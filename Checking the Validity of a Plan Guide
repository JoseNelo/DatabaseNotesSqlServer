Use the system function sys.fn_validate_plan_guide, which allows you to check the validity of existing plan
guides.

USE AdventureWorks2014;
GO
SELECT pg.plan_guide_id, pg.name, v.msgnum,
v.severity, v.state, v.message
FROM sys.plan_guides pg
CROSS APPLY sys.fn_validate_plan_guide(pg.plan_guide_id) v;




If this query returns no rows, this means there are no errors with existing plan guides. If rows are generated,
you will need to re-create a valid plan guide based on the changed circumstances.
