SQL Server provides four commands that are used to return query and batch execution statistics and
information:
SET STATISTICS IO, 
SET STATISTICS TIME,      (amount of time a query takes to execute from end to end)
SET STATISTICS PROFILE, and 
SET STATISTICS XML

logical read values (reads from the data cache),
high physical (reads from disk)
