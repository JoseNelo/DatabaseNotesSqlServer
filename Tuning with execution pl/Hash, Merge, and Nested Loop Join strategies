Estimated Execution Plan is a kind of blue-print that defines how a query should actually perform
Actual Execution Plan is like a mirror that tells you what happened while executing the query

three physical join operators
 Hash Join: physical operator for query in case of high volume of data that is not sorted or indexed, creates an in-memory hash table based on the equijoin keys.
 Merge Join: operator for query in case of a sorted join expression.
 Nested Loop Join: The Nested Loop Join operator works well with at least two result sets, and out of these, one is relatively small that is used as an outer loop input, and
another result set with efficient index works as inner loop set

Scan Scan looks at each and every row available in the table/index
seek has address of each row based on the key field value,goes to that data page and fetches the row if your predicate matches with the key field.

Key Lookup: storage engine has to go to clustered index from non-clustered index

never try to advise optimizer to use a Merge or a Nested Loop by providing an
OPTION query hint, as it may degrade the performance. A Nested Loop works best only
with a small dataset, as described in this recipe

--use
--OPTION(LOOP JOIN) for Nested Loop Join
--OPTION(HASH JOIN)for HashJoin
--OPTION(MERGEJOIN) for Merge Join
