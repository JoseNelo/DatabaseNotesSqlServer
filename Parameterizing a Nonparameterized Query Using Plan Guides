You have been monitoring the server health and have noticed that there is a very large query cache filled with
nearly identical queries.

For applications that make heavy use of ad hoc queries, Iâ€™ll often see a very large query cache filled with
nearly identical queries.

USE AdventureWorks2014;
GO
SELECT cp.objtype, st.text
FROM sys.dm_exec_cached_plans cp
CROSS APPLY sys.dm_exec_sql_text(cp.plan_handle) st
WHERE st.text LIKE 'SELECT BusinessEntityID%';
GO



If you cannot control the form in which queries are called by the execution, one option you have is to use a
plan guide to force parameterization of the query

The sp_get_query_template system stored procedure makes deploying template plan guides a little easier
by taking a query and outputting the parameterized form of it for use by sp_create_ plan_guide

SELECT BusinessEntityID
FROM HumanResources.Employee
WHERE NationalIDNumber = 509647174

SELECT BusinessEntityID
FROM HumanResources.Employee
WHERE NationalIDNumber = 245797967

SELECT BusinessEntityID
FROM HumanResources.Employee
WHERE NationalIDNumber = 295847284

SELECT cp.objtype, st.text
FROM sys.dm_exec_cached_plans cp
CROSS APPLY sys.dm_exec_sql_text(cp.plan_handle) st
WHERE st.text LIKE 'SELECT BusinessEntityID%';
GO

DECLARE @sql nvarchar(max) DECLARE @parms nvarchar(max)
EXEC sp_get_query_template
N'SELECT BusinessEntityID FROM HumanResources.Employee WHERE NationalIDNumber = 295847284',
@sql OUTPUT,
@parms OUTPUT;
EXEC sp_create_plan_guide N'PG_Employee_Contact_Ouery', @sql,
N'TEMPLATE', NULL, @parms, N'OPTION(PARAMETERIZATION FORCED)';
