number of reads or writes that occur when a query is executed
Query the sys.dm_exec_query_stats DMV to view performance statistics for cached query plans.

clear the procedure cache so that you can identify
the query more easily in this demonstration (remember that you should clear out the procedure cache only on
test SQL Server instances).

DBCC FREEPROCCACHE; 


GO
USE AdventureWorks2012;
GO
SELECT BusinessEntityID, TerritoryID, SalesQuota
FROM Sales.SalesPerson;

This information is useful for identifying read-intensive and/or write-intensive queries  

Also note that
sys.dm_exec_query_stats has other useful columns that can measure CPU time (total_worker_time, last_
worker_time, min_worker_time, and max_worker_time) and .NET CLR object execution time (total_clr_time,
last_clr_time, min_clr_time, max_clr_time).
