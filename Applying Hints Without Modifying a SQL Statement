SQL Server provides a solution to this common issue using plan guides
Plan guides allow you to apply hints
to a query without having to change the actual query text sent from the application

Plan guides can be applied to specific queries embedded within database objects

To remove or disable a plan guide, use the sp_control_plan_guide system stored procedure

If, for example, I want SQL Server to use a different join method, but without having to change the actual
query sent by the application, I can enforce this change by creating a plan guide. The following plan guide is
created to apply a join hint onto the query being sent from the application:

USE AdventureWorks2012;
GO
SELECT name, is_disabled, scope_type_desc, hints
FROM sys.plan_guides;
