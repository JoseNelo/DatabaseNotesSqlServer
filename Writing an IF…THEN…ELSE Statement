DECLARE @QuerySelector int = 3;
IF @QuerySelector = 1
BEGIN
SELECT TOP 3 ProductID, Name, Color
FROM Production.Product
WHERE Color = 'Silver'
ORDER BY Name
END
ELSE
BEGIN
SELECT TOP 3 ProductID, Name, Color
FROM Production.Product
WHERE Color = 'Black'
ORDER BY Name
END;

Your IF expression can be any expression evaluating to TRUE, FALSE, or NULL. You are free to use AND, OR, and
NOT; parentheses for grouping; and all the common operators that you are used to using for equality, greater than,
less than, and so forth. The following is a somewhat contrived example showing some of the possibilities:
IF (@QuerySelector = 1 OR @QuerySelector = 3) AND (NOT @QuerySelector IS NULL)

Because the solution example is written with only one statement in each block, you can omit the BEGINâ€¦END
