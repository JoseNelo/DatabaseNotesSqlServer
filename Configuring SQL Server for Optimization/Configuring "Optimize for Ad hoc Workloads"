When the new query arrives for the first time, only the query_hash value is kept in memory,
instead of the entire plan. When the same query arrives for the second time, SQL Server
identifies that it already has a query_hash for this query  

how much space is consumed by ad hoc queries in a
procedure cache that has been run only once, you can run following query
SELECT
SUM(size_in_bytes) as TotalByteConsumedByAdHoc
FROM
sys.dm_exec_cached_plans
WHERE
objtype = 'Adhoc'
AND usecounts = 1
