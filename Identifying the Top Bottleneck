your number-one tool for identifying is the sys.dm_os_wait_stats DMV. 

provides a running total of all waits encountered by executing
threads in the SQL Server instance.
shows the top two wait types that have accumulated for the SQL Server instance since it
was last cleared or since the instance started:

USE AdventureWorks2012;
GO
SELECT TOP 2
wait_type, wait_time_ms FROM sys.dm_os_wait_stats WHERE wait_type NOT IN
('LAZYWRITER_SLEEP', 'SQLTRACE_BUFFER_FLUSH', 'REQUEST_FOR_DEADLOCK_SEARCH', 'LOGMGR_QUEUE',
'CHECKPOINT_QUEUE', 'CLR_AUTO_EVENT','WAITFOR', 'BROKER_TASK_STOP', 'SLEEP_TASK', 'BROKER_TO_
FLUSH')
ORDER BY wait_time_ms DESC;

If you want to clear the currently accumulated wait type statistics, you can then run the following query:
DBCC SQLPERF ('sys.dm_os_wait_stats', CLEAR);

The DMVâ€™s data is grouped at the instance level, not at the database level
