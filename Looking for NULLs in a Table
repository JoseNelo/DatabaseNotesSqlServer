To search for NULL values, use the unary operators IS NULL and IS NOT NULL
The ISNULL function is often confused with the IS NULL operator

there are some differences in how the SQL Server query plan
optimizer decides how to execute statements with IS NULL vs. ISNULL used as a predicate in a SELECT statement
All three statements return the same rows, but there is a difference in
the execution plan.

By using the IS NULL operator, SQL Server is able to seek on the index instead of scan the index. ISNULL() is
a function, when a column is passed into a function SQL Server must evaluate that function for every row and is
not able to seek on an index to satisfy the WHERE clause.
