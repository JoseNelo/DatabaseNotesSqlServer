The default sort order is an ascending sort. NULL values sort to the top in an ascending sort.
You want to sort by columns not returned by the query.
Solution
Simply specify the columns you wish to sort by. They do not need to be in your query results
You can sort by any column. It doesnâ€™t matter whether that column is in the SELECT list. What does matter is that
the column must be available to the query.
ordering by unselected columns is that ORDER BY items must appear in the SELECT list if
SELECT DISTINCT is specified

  SELECT p.ProductID,
    p.Name,
    p.Color
    FROM Production.Product AS p
    WHERE p.Color IS NOT NULL
    ORDER BY CASE p.Color
    WHEN 'Red' THEN NULL
    ELSE p.Color
    END;
