SELECT ProductID, Name
FROM Production.Product
ORDER BY Name
OFFSET 8 ROWS FETCH NEXT 10 ROWS ONLY;  

Changing the offset from 0 to 8 will fetch another 10 rows. The offset will skip the first eight rows. There will
be a two-row overlap with the preceding result set

Use OFFSET to specify how many rows to skip from the beginning of the possible result set. Use FETCH to set the
number of rows to return. You can change either value as you wish from one execution to the next.
You must specify an ORDER BY clause! OFFSET and FETCH are actually considered as part of that clause
