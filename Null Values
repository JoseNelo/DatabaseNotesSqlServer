--Some of the values in a column might be NULL. You wish to identify rows having or not having NULL values.
--Solution
Make use of the IS NULL and IS NOT NULL tests to identify rows having or not having NULL values in a given
column. For example, the following query returns any rows for which the value of the productâ€™s weight is
unknown:
SELECT ProductID,
Name,
Weight
FROM Production.Product
WHERE Weight IS NULL;

NULL values cannot be identified using operators such as = and <> that are designed to compare two values
and return a TRUE or FALSE result
Weight = NULL yields the value UNKNOWN, which is neither TRUE nor FALSE
Weight <> NULL also yields UNKNOWN
IS NULL however, is specifically designed to return TRUE when a value is NULL. Likewise, the expression IS
NOT NULL returns TRUE when a value is not NULL. Predicates involving IS NULL and IS NOT NULL enable you to
filter for rows having or not having NULL values in one or more columns.
