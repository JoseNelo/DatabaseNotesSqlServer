you want to build a
search string, store that search string into a variable, and reference the string in the WHERE clause of a subsequent
query


Execute a DECLARE statement. Specify the variable and the data type.
Variables are objects you can create to temporarily contain data.
new variable that is prefixed by the @ symbol and followed by the defining data type
DECLARE @AddressLine1 nvarchar(60)
DECLARE @AddressLine1 nvarchar(60) = 'Heiderplatz';


You can also specify a value by executing a SET statement, and prior to SQL Server 2008, you are required to
do so. Here's an example:
DECLARE @AddressLine1 nvarchar(60);
SET @AddressLine1 = 'Heiderplatz';

WHERE AddressLine1 LIKE '%' + @AddressLine1 + '%'

It's possible to declare a variable without assigning a value. In that case, the variable is said to be null. Here's
an example:
DECLARE @AddressLine1 nvarchar(60);
SELECT @AddressLine1;
Results from this query are as follows:
---------------------------------------
NULL
(1 row(s) affected)
